# Code Grader API - AI-Powered Educational Assessment System

## What I Built

This is a  AI-powered code grading and analytics system that I developed as a Graduate Teaching Assistant. It's designed to solve real problems by providing consistent, rubric-based grading and deep insights into student learning patterns. This system is well equiped with logging service, rate limiting service and a caching service

## Current Architecture & Capabilities


1. Automatically cleans and structures student submissions
2. Handles complex lab submissions with multiple components (Lab1A, Lab1B, Lab1C)
3. Two AI models work together - one for initial grading, another for quality assurance
4. Every evaluation follows predefined rubrics to maintain consistency

### Advanced Analytics & Insights

#### ðŸ“Š Student Performance Analytics

### Real Student Performance Analysis Example

Here's what a student gets when they request their performance analysis:

```json
{
    "student_id": "STU199998",
    "name": "Stephanie Chen",
    "section": "23",
    "semester": "Spring 2025",
    "instructor_name": "Dr. Sarah Johnson",
    "total_evaluations": 1,
    "total_points_lost": 47,
    "average_points_lost": 47.0,
    "lab_breakdown": [
        {
            "lab_name": "Lab6",
            "count": 1,
            "avg_points": 47.0,
            "total_points": 47
        }
    ],
    "recent_evaluations": [
        {
            "lab_name": "Lab6",
            "points_lost": 47,
            "date": "2025-06-21T18:07:17.258000+00:00"
        }
    ],
    "performance_summary": "The student demonstrates a solid understanding of linked list concepts, indicating comfort with data structures. However, the significant points lost suggest struggles with complex operations involving these structures, which may include loops for traversal and manipulation. To improve, the student should focus on enhancing their skills in handling complex data structures and refining their error handling and code structure for better clarity and efficiency.",
    "suggestions": {
        "student_name": "Stephanie Chen",
        "topics_identified": [
            "complex data structures",
            "linked list operations", 
            "error handling and code structure"
        ],
        "materials_found": 3,
        "suggestions": "complex data structures: fundamentals-of-computer-programming-with-csharp-nakov-ebook-v2013.pdf\nlinked list operations: jjj-os-20170625.pdf\nerror handling and code structure: fundamentals-of-computer-programming-with-csharp-nakov-ebook-v2013.pdf",

    }
}
```

### Future ->  College Resource Search Capabilities

I want to extend this system to include intelligent search across all college-related resources. Students can ask natural language questions and get instant answers:

For Example
####  **Student Services & Support**
- *"Can I get the phone number of student services?"*
- *"Where is the financial aid office located?"*
- *"What are the tutoring center hours?"*
- *"How do I contact my academic advisor?"*

#### **Campus Events & Activities**
- *"What are the upcoming events this week?"*
- *"When is the next career fair?"*
- *"Are there any workshops on resume building?"*
- *"What's happening during homecoming weekend?"*

#### **Academic Information**
- *"Do I have any assignments or exams this week?"*
- *"When is spring break?"*
- *"What's the deadline for course registration?"*
- *"When do final exams start?"*

#### **Faculty & Course Information**
- *"Who will teach CS Algorithms next semester?"*
- *"What are Professor Smith's office hours?"*
- *"Which sections of Calculus are still open?"*
- *"What prerequisites do I need for Data Structures?"*

#### **Campus Facilities**
- *"What time does the library close?"*
- *"Where can I find a computer lab?"*
- *"Is the gym open on weekends?"*
- *"What dining options are available today?"*
#### *Financial & Administrative**

- *"How do I apply for scholarships?"*
- *"What's the process for dropping a class?"*
- *"Where can I get my student ID card?"*
